# Map-Animation
Using Boston MBTA data, a bus route is animated on a map between the MIT and Harvard campuses with the click of a button

## How to Run:
In this project you will need to manually edit the mapanimation.js file to add an API key.  

First option to save the files locally to your computer, from the GitHub repository page you must copy the files either through the git clone process of your choosing or you may download the compressed files in a .zip file and save to a new folder.  Right-click on the index.html file to open with a web browser such a Google Chrome.

Steps to create a Mapbox Access Token (API Key) for the mapanimation.js file (https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/get-started-tokens-api/).

Click the button 'MIT show stops between MIT and Harvard' to move a marker along the bus stops between the two college campuses, or show animation, on a map.  

## Important API Key Info:
The main purpose of an API key is to identify your application. Additionally, API keys will often allow the API to do things like rate limit, meaning it can control how many requests it processes from your application during a given period of time.  Itâ€™s important to know since your application is identified by the API key, do not share it on the internet.

Once you have finished, you can delete the Access Token (API Key).  Please remember never commit this key to a public git repository or paste it in a support forum.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements:
No future improvements scheduled at this time.
